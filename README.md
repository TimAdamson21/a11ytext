# a11ytext
A pdf / image to text converter that helps students learn

When a professor uploads an image of text, whether it's a page of a book or their handwritten
notes, it is not immediately accessible to those who are visually impaired.

Currently, at the University of Washington, students with visual and learning disabilities have to wait for staff
to get inaccessible materials that can't be used with screen readers or text-to-speech tools into an accessible format for the students.
This process adds extra time and is a cost to the campus.

With A11y Text, these students can upload all of their academic materials as PDFs, JPGs, or PNGs
and download versions they can use in a simple text file. Minimal wait time and no travel required.
